# 🏦 Loan Status Prediction using Machine Learning

## Part of my 50 Days, 50 Projects Challenge to strengthen my Data Science and Machine Learning skills.

This project focuses on predicting whether a loan application will be approved or rejected based on applicant financial, demographic, and credit history features using Machine Learning models.

The goal is to help financial institutions reduce risk, automate decision-making, and improve loan approval efficiency.

## Problem Statement

Loan approval is a critical decision for banks and NBFCs. Manual evaluation is time-consuming and prone to bias.

This project builds a predictive model that determines loan approval status using applicant information such as income, credit history, loan amount, employment status, and property details.

## Exploratory Data Analysis Insights

Credit history is the strongest factor influencing loan approval

Applicants with higher income and lower loan amount have higher approval probability

Urban and semi-urban applicants show slightly better approval rates

Graduate applicants have better approval chances
